# ConfiguratorContentProxy
Proxies content from Configurator for externally developed web sites.

To use this, set your tenant, ApiKey and Url in the settings.config file.  Requests to the Proxy will be forwarded to configurator via authenticated request so the content can be returned to a non-authenticated client.
